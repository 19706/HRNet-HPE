## Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation

This is an unofficial implementation of the paper
 [*Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09212).  
The code is a simplified version of the [official code](https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch)
 with the ease-of-use in mind.

The code is fully compatible with the
 [official pre-trained weights](https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch) and the results are the
 same of the original implementation (very little differences on gpu due to CUDA).
